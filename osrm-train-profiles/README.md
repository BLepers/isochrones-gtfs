# OSRM Lua profile for trains

This repo contains a profile for routing (mostly freight) trains with [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/). This enables you to find the shortest path by train between 2 points and also do map matching with OSRM.

*Note:* travel time estimations are way too optimistic due to the red lights, stations and traffic not taken into account

Right now, it contains, 2 profiles :

## `basic.lua`
A basic/naive profile that works quite well.

## `freight.lua`
A profile optimized for freight trains:

* Default speed is 130 km/h
* Highspeed lines are de-prioritized
* Has flags to completely exclude highspeed lines and/or non electrified segments
* Rejects all gauges that are not 1435mm

Possible improvements that we might one day include :

* Preferred left-hand driving even where OSM does not specify it (if you know how to implement it, please be in touch !)
* Better turn restrictions/penalties
* Speed limitation in curves
* Time penalty for traffic lights or when passing trough stations

Inspiration for the code taken from [an old russian blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20170608052036/http://flexnst.ru/2015/11/20/osrm-railway-profile/) and [the car profile](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/profiles/car.lua)

# How to run this?

First, you will need to install the Docker daemon and osmium (`osmium-tool` on Ubuntu) on your machine.
Then, run `make all` to download the OSM data, filter and combine it and finally compute the routing graph.

Last, run `make serve` to serve the OSRM server locally on port `5000`
