This directory contains a `Dockerfile` and an AWS Codebuild `buildspec.yml` used
internally by Railnova to build a Docker image containing the OSRM graph and
pushing it to out private image repository in AWS ECR.

You are free to use those under the same 2-Clause BSD License as the rest of the
code but it might not be very useful to you as is.
